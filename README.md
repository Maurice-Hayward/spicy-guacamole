A lot of  open source projects on GitHub are similar ( e.g. Underscore.js vs. Lodash.js). I'm hoping to create a website that compares different  GitHub repos, using the number of contributors, the frequency of updates, the number of downloads,  whether there is a code of conduct, and so on. But my unique feature will be the use sentiment analysis.  I want to use sentiment analysis on GitHub issues to measure the attitude of the open source project's community. Hopefully, this can help someone decide whether to use and contribute to a project.
